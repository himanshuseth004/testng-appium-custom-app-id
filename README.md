# How to install apps in Real Devices using Custom App ID on [LambdaTest](https://www.lambdatest.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=LT-appium-java-testNG-customName) using the Appium Java TestNG Framework

While performing app automation testing with Appium on LambdaTest Grid, you might face a scenario where the APP ID generated by you is lost/confusing since it looks something like this - ```lt://APP12430338390303038292```.
You can easily change this to something readable like this - ```Proverbial Android v1.56```.
Let's quickly learn how to achieve this.
### Setting Up Your Authentication

Make sure you have your LambdaTest credentials with you to run test automation scripts on LambdaTest. To obtain your access credentials, [purchase a plan](https://billing.lambdatest.com/billing/plans) or access the [Automation Dashboard](https://appautomation.lambdatest.com/).

Set LambdaTest `Username` and `Access Key` in environment variables.

**For Linux/macOS:**

```bash
export LT_USERNAME="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME" \
export LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY"
```
  
**For Windows:**

```bash
set LT_USERNAME="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME" `
set LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY"
```
 
### Upload Your Application
Upload your **_iOS_** application (.ipa file) or **_android_** application (.apk file) to the LambdaTest servers using our **REST API**. You need to provide your **Username** and **AccessKey** in the format `Username:AccessKey` in the **cURL** command for authentication. Make sure to add the path of the **appFile** in the cURL request. Here is an example cURL request to upload your app using our REST API:
**Using App File:**
**Linux/macOS:**
```js
curl -u "YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME:YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY" \
--location --request POST 'https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice' \
--form 'name="Android_App"' \
--form 'appFile=@"/Users/macuser/Downloads/proverbial_android.apk"' \
--form 'custom_id="ENTER_CUSTOM_ID_HERE"'
```
**Windows:**
```js
curl -u "YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME:YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY" -X POST "https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice" -F "appFile=@"C:\Users\varunkumarb\Downloads\proverbial_android.apk"" -F "custom_id=ENTER_CUSTOM_ID_HERE"
```
**Using App URL:**
**Linux/macOS:**
```js
curl -u "YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME:YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY" \
--location --request POST 'https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice' \
--form 'name="Android_App"' \
--form 'url="https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_android.apk"' \
--form 'custom_id="ENTER_CUSTOM_ID_HERE"'
```
**For Windows:**
```js
curl --location --request POST "https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice" -u "YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME:YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY" --header "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" --data-urlencode "url=https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_android.apk" --data-urlencode "name=teest" --data-urlencode "custom_id=ENTER_CUSTOM_ID_HERE"
```
**Example using a Custom App ID**
```js
curl -u "YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME:YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY" \
--location --request POST 'https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice' \
--form 'name="Android_App"' \
--form 'url="https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_android.apk"' \
--form 'custom_id="Proverbial Android v1.56"'
```
**Tip:**
- If you do not have any **.apk** or **.ipa** file, you can run your sample tests on LambdaTest by using our sample :link: [Android app](https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_android.apk) or sample :link: [iOS app](https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_ios.ipa).
- Response of above cURL will be a **JSON** object containing the `App URL` of the format - <lt://APP123456789123456789> and will be used in the next step.
- Alternatively you can also use the `Custom ID` that you defined in your own words.
## Run Your First Test
Once you are done with the above-mentioned steps, you can initiate your first Java test on LambdaTest.
### Configuring Your Test Capabilities
You can update your custom capabilities in test scripts. In this sample project, we are passing platform name, platform version, device name and app url (generated earlier) along with other capabilities like build name and test name via capabilities object. The capabilities object in the sample code are defined as:

```java
public class AndroidApp {
    String userName = System.getenv("LT_USERNAME") == null ?
            "username" : System.getenv("LT_USERNAME"); //Add username here
    String accessKey = System.getenv("LT_ACCESS_KEY") == null ?
            "accessKey" : System.getenv("LT_ACCESS_KEY"); //Add accessKey here
    public String gridURL = "@mobile-hub.lambdatest.com/wd/hub";
    AppiumDriver driver;
    @Test
    @org.testng.annotations.Parameters(value = {"device", "version", "platform"})
    public void AndroidApp1(String device, String version, String platform) {
        try {
            DesiredCapabilities capabilities = new DesiredCapabilities();
            capabilities.setCapability("build","Java TestNG Android");
            capabilities.setCapability("name",platform+" "+device+" "+version);
            capabilities.setCapability("deviceName", device);
            capabilities.setCapability("platformVersion",version);
            capabilities.setCapability("platformName", platform);
            capabilities.setCapability("isRealMobile", true);
            //Enter the Custom_ID here that was used to upload your application
            capabilities.setCapability("app", "ENTER_CUSTOM_ID_HERE");
            capabilities.setCapability("deviceOrientation", "PORTRAIT");
            capabilities.setCapability("console", true);
            capabilities.setCapability("network", false);
            capabilities.setCapability("visual", true);
            capabilities.setCapability("devicelog", true);
            
            String hub = "https://" + userName + ":" + accessKey + gridURL;
            
            driver = new AppiumDriver(new URL(hub), capabilities);
            
            MobileElement color = (MobileElement) driver.findElementById("com.lambdatest.proverbial:id/color");
            //Changes color to pink
            color.click();
            Thread.sleep(1000);
            MobileElement text = (MobileElement) driver.findElementById("com.lambdatest.proverbial:id/Text");
            //Changes the text to "Proverbial"
            text.click();
            //toast will be visible
            MobileElement toast = (MobileElement) driver.findElementById("com.lambdatest.proverbial:id/toast");
            toast.click();
            //notification will be visible
            MobileElement notification = (MobileElement) driver.findElementById("com.lambdatest.proverbial:id/notification");
            notification.click();
            Thread.sleep(2000);
            //Opens the geolocation page
            MobileElement geo = (MobileElement) driver.findElementById("com.lambdatest.proverbial:id/geoLocation");
            geo.click();
            Thread.sleep(5000);
            //takes back to home page
            MobileElement home = (MobileElement) driver.findElementByAccessibilityId("Home");
            home.click();
            driver.quit();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
            try{
                driver.quit();
            }catch(Exception e1){
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
}
```
### **Step 3: Execute Your Test Case**
Debug and run your code. Run iOSApp.java or AndroidApp.java in your editor.
```
mvn clean install -DsuiteXmlFile=src/test/java/Android.xml
```
```
mvn clean install -DsuiteXmlFile=src/test/java/IOS.xml
```
Info: Your test results would be displayed on the test console (or command-line interface if you are using terminal/cmd) and on the üîó LambdaTest App Automation Dashboard.
